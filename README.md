**Open source product:** 
We will be building a web application that connects volunteer mentors with mentees. The primary goal is to connect young (<=18), in-need people who have limited English skills with mentors. The name of this open-source project is MentorsConnectors. 

**Far vision:** 
Improvement of English skills is just the baseline. We hope that our product can become a global product that will connect people from across the globe with different needs and skill levels. 

**Near vision:** 
As a starter, we want to connect people who have limited English-speaking skills with native English speakers. We hope that mentors will not only help mentees improve their English skills, but also equip with them with other skills to navigate through other other potential types of challenges they might face. 

**Stakeholder types:** 
* Mentors; fluent English-speakers who want to provide mentorship.  
* Mentees; 18 and under non-native speakers who cannot afford paid services and want to learn English. 
* Mentee's family members. 

**A real stakeholder:** 
Indira Khaibulina

**Rational for ordering the product backlog:** 
As a starter, we want to connect people who have limited English-speaking skills with native English speakers; this is our main goal. Our product backlog is ordered as such with the goal of getting the most viable product out of the door ASAP. 

**Our Definition of Ready:** 
A product backlog item is ready when:
- it has a title. 
- it has a clear description
- it has to have an acceptance criteria 
- it has an estimation 

	
**Estimates:**
See [https://trello.com/b/RdosOtmY/a-team-kanban-board](https://trello.com/b/KyAqvLUL/s71-group-project). The numbers between the parentheses represent the story points. 

**Relative Size Estimate:** 
We did a whole team relative size estimating activity. We used the estimation activity Plannning Poker to estimate as a team. Only the developers were involved in estimating the PBIs. 

**PART TWO**
We forecast that we will complete 8 story points during this half sprint. It is difficult to predict how many story points we can complete without a point of comparison (given that this is our first sprint together), however we decided upon a total of 8 story points based off how many points we delegated to each PBI collectively and individually; we think 8 is a reasonable portion and equates to a fourth of the project (as there are four total sprints). 

For this sprint, we pulled the two stories at the top of our product backlog into the sprint backlog; 1) request a mentor and 2) sign up. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed the forecast of 8. Only developers participated in this activity. <img width="777" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 11 55 32 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13064007/176339464-d4cf5f86-8f1e-4ca0-ba55-91e82e239d51.png">
