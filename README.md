**Open source product:** 
We will be building a web application that connects volunteer mentors with mentees. The primary goal is to connect young (<=18), in-need people who have limited English skills with mentors. The name of this open-source project is MentorsConnectors. 

**Far vision:** 
Improvement of English skills is just the baseline. We hope that our product can become a global product that will connect people from across the globe with different needs and skill levels. 

**Near vision:** 
As a starter, we want to connect people who have limited English-speaking skills with native English speakers. We hope that mentors will not only help mentees improve their English skills, but also equip with them with other skills to navigate through other other potential types of challenges they might face. 

**Stakeholder types:** 
* Mentors; fluent English-speakers who want to provide mentorship.  
* Mentees; 18 and under non-native speakers who cannot afford paid services and want to learn English. 
* Mentee's family members.

**Rational for ordering the product backlog:** 
As a starter, we want to connect people who have limited English-speaking skills with native English speakers; this is our main goal. Our product backlog is ordered as such with the goal of getting the most viable product out of the door ASAP. 

**Our Definition of Ready:** 
A product backlog item is ready when:
- it has a title. 
- it has a clear description
- it has to have an acceptance criteria 
- it has an estimation 

	
**Estimates:**
See [https://trello.com/b/RdosOtmY/a-team-kanban-board](https://trello.com/b/KyAqvLUL/s71-group-project). The numbers between the parentheses represent the story points. 

**Relative Size Estimate:** 
We did a whole team relative size estimating activity. We used the estimation activity Plannning Poker to estimate as a team. Only the developers were involved in estimating the PBIs. 

**PART TWO**

We forecast that we will complete 8 story points during this half sprint. It is difficult to predict how many story points we can complete without a point of comparison (given that this is our first sprint together), however we decided upon a total of 8 story points based off how many points we delegated to each PBI collectively and individually; we think 8 is a reasonable portion and equates to a fourth of the project (as there are four total sprints). 

forcast velocity: 10 point

For this sprint, we pulled the two stories at the top of our product backlog into the sprint backlog; 1) request a mentor and 2) sign up. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed the forecast of 8. Only developers participated in this activity.

The sprint backlog, including both the user stories and developer tasks, is represented in a kanban board. The URL of the kanban board is represented [here](https://trello.com/b/KyAqvLUL/s71-group-project). Course staff can view the kanban board.

*Documentation of 06/28/2022 Daily Scrum* (general format of how our conversation went):

*Arno*: Can we all give a quick update on the tasks we're working on or worked on yesterday? Also, please let me know if any of you are blocked or need help with anything :)

*Anara*: Yesterday, I worked on creating a webpage for mentors to be able to submit a form to volunteer. The task is in review right now and is assigned to *Khaled*. I believe it will fullfll all the acceptance criteria. Khaled â€“ let me know when you get a chance to look at it. 

*Anara*: Today I will be working with Khaled and Arno on creating a webpage that allows mentees to request mentors. I myself don't have any blockers.

*Khaled*: I'm reviewing the "Become a mentor" webpage Anara just finished building and, as Anara mentioned, I will be also working with her and Arno on creating the mentee's page.

*Arno*: Great! What are people working on in the next 24 hours? 
*Khaled and Anara*: We will be mob programming and implementing some TDD for the "Become a Mentor" page. 

*Arno*: Looks like we're on track. Any other comments, questions or concerns?
*Khaled*: nope!
*Anara*: no :)

**Sprint Review**
The stakeholder reviewed the MVP product and idscuussed the product features they'd like to see on our app. She was thrilled with the progress that we made during the first sprint and encourged us to keep us the hardwork. Please see screenshot below of our Zoom meeting

**Sprint Retrospective**
Anara suggested that we spend more time on spring planning beacuse we realized we have a lot of questions when we started workign on user storeis. 
Arno thought we need to do more sprints in person than over zoom because he feels we're more productive when we work in person.
Khaled echoed what everyone said and thought we all did great. PBIs are created to represent our users storeis revised order according to our definition of ready and estimated workload.

**PART THREE**

We forecast that we will complete 4 story points during this half sprint. We decided upon a total of 4 story points primarily because of the shorter sprint (due to the fourth of July holiday), and based off how many points we delegated to each PBI collectively and individually. 

Forcast velocity = Previous forecast velocity / 2 = 10/2 = 5 points. This the same velocity as last time, only we divided by two to account for the holidays. Only developers participated in this activity.
